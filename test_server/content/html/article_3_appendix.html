    <h1>Appendix: Ethical Scraping Guidelines</h1>
    <div id="article-body">
        <p>Respect website terms of service and robots.txt directives. Implement exponential backoff
        for retries and cache responses when appropriate. These practices demonstrate respect for the resources you're
        accessing and help maintain the sustainability of web scraping as an acceptable data gathering method. Ignoring
        these guidelines can lead to IP bans, legal issues, and contributes to a negative perception of web scraping
        in general. By following ethical standards, you help ensure that valuable web data remains accessible to
        responsible developers and researchers.</p>

        <p>Identify your bot with a proper User-Agent header and provide contact information.
        This helps website owners reach you if there are concerns. A descriptive User-Agent that includes your project name,
        version, and contact email shows transparency and professionalism. When site administrators can easily identify
        and contact bot operators, it enables constructive dialogue rather than immediate blocking. Many website owners
        are willing to work with legitimate scrapers when approached respectfully and given the opportunity to set
        reasonable boundaries.</p>

        <p>Consider the broader impact of your scraping activities on server resources, bandwidth costs, and other users
        accessing the same website. Schedule intensive scraping during off-peak hours, distribute requests across time,
        and be prepared to throttle or pause your operations if you detect performance issues. Ethical scraping isn't
        just about following rules—it's about being a responsible member of the web community.</p>
