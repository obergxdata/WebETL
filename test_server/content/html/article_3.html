    <h1>Article 3: Web Scraping Best Practices</h1>
    <div id="article-body">
        <p>When scraping websites, it's important to be respectful and follow best practices.
        Always check robots.txt, rate-limit your requests, and handle errors gracefully. Being a responsible web scraper
        means understanding that every request you make consumes server resources and bandwidth. Implementing proper delays
        between requests, respecting crawl-delay directives, and backing off when you receive error responses demonstrates
        good citizenship in the web ecosystem and helps maintain positive relationships with content providers.</p>

        <p>Consider using structured data formats like RSS feeds when available, as they are
        designed for automated consumption and are more reliable than scraping HTML. These formats provide stable,
        well-documented structures that are less likely to change unexpectedly compared to HTML layouts. When websites
        offer APIs or RSS feeds, using them instead of HTML scraping results in more maintainable code, better performance,
        and reduced risk of your scraper breaking due to website redesigns.</p>

        <p>Proper error handling and logging are crucial components of any web scraping system. Implement retry logic with
        exponential backoff for transient failures, maintain detailed logs of your scraping activities, and monitor for
        changes in website structure. Building robust scrapers that can adapt to minor changes and gracefully handle
        unexpected situations will save you significant maintenance time and ensure reliable data collection over the
        long term.</p>
