    <h1>Article 3: Web Scraping Best Practices</h1>
    <p>When scraping websites, it's important to be respectful and follow best practices.
    Always check robots.txt, rate-limit your requests, and handle errors gracefully.</p>

    <p>Consider using structured data formats like RSS feeds when available, as they are
    designed for automated consumption and are more reliable than scraping HTML.</p>
