    <h1>Appendix: RSS Technical Details</h1>
    <p>RSS feeds use XML namespaces to extend functionality. Common elements include
    channel, item, title, link, description, and pubDate.</p>

    <p>The two most common RSS versions are RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0. Both serve similar purposes
    but have different XML structures and capabilities.</p>
