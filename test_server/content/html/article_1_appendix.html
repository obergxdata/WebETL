    <h1>Appendix: RSS Technical Details</h1>
    <div id="article-body">
        <p>RSS feeds use XML namespaces to extend functionality. Common elements include
        channel, item, title, link, description, and pubDate. These core elements form the foundation of every RSS feed,
        with the channel representing the feed itself and items representing individual entries. Extensions through
        namespaces allow publishers to include additional metadata such as media enclosures, Dublin Core metadata,
        content encodings, and custom fields specific to their domain or application needs.</p>

        <p>The two most common RSS versions are RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0. Both serve similar purposes
        but have different XML structures and capabilities. RSS 2.0 is simpler and more widely adopted, making it easier
        to implement for basic syndication needs. Atom 1.0 offers more rigorous specifications, better internationalization
        support, and clearer semantics for different types of content. Understanding the differences helps you choose the
        right format for your publishing needs or build parsers that handle both formats correctly.</p>

        <p>When implementing RSS feeds, pay attention to proper XML encoding, valid timestamps in ISO 8601 or RFC 822 format,
        and correct MIME types for media enclosures. Well-formed feeds ensure maximum compatibility across different feed
        readers and aggregators, while poorly structured feeds may be rejected or misinterpreted by consuming applications.</p>
