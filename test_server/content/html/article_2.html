    <h1>Article 2: Understanding HTML Parsing</h1>
    <div id="article-body">
        <p>HTML parsing is the process of analyzing HTML documents to extract structured data.
        Modern parsers can handle malformed HTML and provide a consistent DOM representation. This capability is
        essential in web scraping and data extraction tasks where you need to process HTML from various sources
        that may not always follow strict standards. The robustness of modern parsers allows developers to work
        with real-world web content reliably.</p>

        <p>Popular Python libraries for HTML parsing include BeautifulSoup, lxml, and html5lib.
        Each has its own strengths and use cases. BeautifulSoup excels at providing an intuitive API that makes
        navigating and searching the parse tree straightforward. The lxml library offers superior performance and
        is ideal for processing large documents quickly, while html5lib focuses on standards compliance and parses
        HTML exactly as web browsers do, making it perfect for applications requiring browser-equivalent behavior.</p>

        <p>Understanding the trade-offs between these libraries helps you choose the right tool for your specific needs.
        Consider factors like parsing speed, memory usage, error handling capabilities, and whether you need strict
        standards compliance or flexible parsing of potentially broken HTML. The right choice can significantly impact
        both development time and application performance.</p>
